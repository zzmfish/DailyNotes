#### Fundamental Techniques In Handling People

> 1, Don’t criticize, <u>condemn</u> or complain.

> 2, Give honest and sincere appreciation.

> 3, <u>Arouse</u> in the other person an eager want.



#### Six Ways To Make People Like You

> 1, Become <u>genuinely</u> interested in other people.

> 2, Smile.

> 3, Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

> 4, Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.

> 5, Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.

> 6, Make the other person feel important—and do it sincerely.

#### How To Win People To Your Way Of Thinking

> 1, The only way to get the best of an argument  is to avoid it.

* Nine times of ten, an argument ends with each of <u>contestants</u> more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right.
* Buddha(佛) said: "<u>Hatred</u> is never ended by hatred but by love, " and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, <u>diplomancy</u>, <u>conciliation</u> and a <u>sympathetic</u> desire to see the other person's viewpoint.

> 2, Show respect for the other person's opions. Nerver day, "You're wrong."

* You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.
* When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and <u>tactfully</u>, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our <u>frankness</u> and <u>broad-mindedness</u>.
* I judge people by their own principles——not by my own.

> 3, If you are wrong, admit it quickly and <u>emphatically</u>.

> 4, Begin in a friendly way.

> 5, Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately.

> 6, Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.

> 7, Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.

* No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying <u>of our own accord</u> or acting on our own ideas. We like to be <u>consulted</u> about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.
* The reason why rivers and seas receive the <u>homage</u> of a houdred mountain streams is that they keep below them. So the <u>sage</u>, wishing to be above men, puts himself below them; wishing to be before them, he puts himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury. 

> 8, Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.

> 9, Be <u>sympathetic</u> with the other person’s ideas and desires.

> 10, Appeal to the nobler motives.

> 11, <u>Dramatize</u> your ideas.

> 12, Throw down a challenge.



#### How To Change People Without Giving Offence Or Arousing Resentment

> 1, Begin with praise and honest appreciation.

> 2, Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.

> 3, Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.

> 4, Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.

> 5, Let the other person save face.

> 6, Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”

> 7, Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.

> 8, Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.

> 9, Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
